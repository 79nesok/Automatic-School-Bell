**Automatic school bell** is a program used to ring the bell automatically for daily schedules, events, exams and recurring schedules. This program is intended to facilitate school administration in managing the time to ring the bell for a given schedule. Audio can be specified independently based on each school need. It uses SQL Server as the backend that allows to store data quickly and reliably.

Furthermore, the program also uses windows service technology as a backend service to ring the bell in realtime and parallel manner in which we do not need to run its GUI program when windows starts up. Schedules will be checked each second by Service Runner that is run by Windows Service when windows starts up. Even you can make your computer in lock mode (if necessary set password) without going to desktop.
